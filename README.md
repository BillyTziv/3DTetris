# Concept
The concept is the same, as the one in a simple tetris game but you can also stop the game and view the 3d space.

The project was developed in C++ language using openGL graphics library.

# Installation
To run and play the game, OpenGL is necessary. In Ubuntu 16.04LTS you will need to follow the next steps in order to install the OpenGL and play the game.

1. sudo apt-get install build-essential
2. sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
3. Download the library from http://www.rpmseek.com/rpm-pl/libglui2c2.html?hl=com&cs=libgcc1:RE:0:0:0:0:2420 according to your system. Then use sudo dpkg -i <package> to install it.

Now you should be able to play the game! Enjoy! :)
