# VraXaPsa

The concept is the same, as the one in a simple tetris game but instead of various cube shapes, the possible objects that may be dropping from the top are rocks, scissors, papers, bombs and magic cubes. Some of the objects win/'eat' others. For example, a rock wins all scissors and a paper wins all rocks. Bombs win everything and magic cubes can be win other by bombs.
